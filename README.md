# Finsweet

A group of content writers who share their learnings.

## The Problem

A group of authors needed a shared but exclusive "place" to share their learning and experiences and promote themselves to the community and people.

## The solution

The solution was to create a web platform that is used as a blog post but for a specific group of people who faced that problem with the ability to grow the team by receiving request from other writers through the website.

## User Journey

- When the user first opens the website, he will se the landing page in which ha can see the most recent post, the featured post, all the posts with the ability to go to all posts page when view all button is clicked, the vision and mission of our team, the categories to choose one of them, the list of our authors in the teams, the platforms we are featured in, testimonials about the blog, a section to join our team which takes you to the form section, and a footer.
- At all posts page, the user will see the featured post at the top of the page, then he will see all the posts with a small pagination at the bottom of the section. Also he can choose between the categories to show the posts, join our team if he hits join now button, and finally he will find the same footer.
- If the user clicks on one of the posts, he will be directed to a page with the full details of the post, the page also contains more posts to read section and join our team section, with our the general footer..
- If the user clicks on "About Us" on the header or footer, he will be directed to "About Us" page. "About Us" page contains an overview section, know more about us section, why we started section, list of the authors, the very same join our team section, and the footer.
- When the user clicks on the "Blog" button on the header or footer, he will be directed to the blog page with the business as the default topic. He can see a posts about business, the categories cards, the tags of the category, and finally our general footer.
- If you click on one of the author names where ever you find them, it will direct you to the author profile in which you can find his personal info, hist social links, his posts, and finally the footer.
- If you click on "Contact Us" in the footer or the header or you click on "Join Now" button on join our team section, you will be directed to Contact Us page which contains a heading section, a contacts card, a form for contacts, and the footer.
- If you click on "Privacy Policy" in the footer, you will be directed to the privacy policy page that contains a heading section, the privacy terms, and the footer.
